                 The croissant’s story begins not in France, but in Austria. 
                In the late 1600s, Viennese bakers created a pastry called the kipferl, 
                a crescent-shaped bread made to celebrate the victory over the Ottoman Empire. 
                Its shape was inspired by the crescent moon — the symbol on the Ottoman flag.

            <p id="born_details" class="para_details second_page_details">
                 The kipferl traveled to France in the 18th century, 
                when Austrian baker August Zang opened a Viennese bakery in Paris. 
                French bakers were fascinated by the flaky layers and buttery texture, 
                and soon adapted the recipe using their signature puff pastry dough. 
                Thus, the modern croissant was born — lighter, richer, and irresistibly French.
